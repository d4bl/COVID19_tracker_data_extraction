# COVID19_tracker_data_extraction
Data is often not collected by Black communities when it is needed the most. We have compiled a list of all of the states that have shared data on COVID-19 infections and deaths by race and those who have not. This effort is to extract this data from websites to track disparities COVID-19 deaths and cases for Black people.
